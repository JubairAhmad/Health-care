            <p>Our Vision: A Healthier World</p>

            <p>Our Purpose: Transforming lives and communities through excellence in care, discovery and learning.</p>

            <p>University Health Network encompasses the Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and The Michener Institute of Education at UHN. The scope of research and complexity of cases at UHN has made us a national and international source for discovery, education and patient care. We have the largest hospital-based research program in Canada, with major research in cardiology, transplantation, neurosciences, oncology, surgical innovation, infectious diseases, genomic medicine and rehabilitation medicine.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In 2019, Toronto General Hospital was named among the world’s Top 10 Hospitals by Newsweek magazine. We were ranked first on Canada’s Top 40 Research Hospitals list for 2018, and have been consistently ranked at the top since the rankings began by Research Infosource Inc. in 2011.

            Our seven Essentials represent our central priorities as a leading academic health sciences centre:

            Compassionate & Caring | Environments | Operational Excellence | Partnerships | People & Culture | Quality & Safety | Technology

            To learn more about where we’re going and how we’re getting there, read our 2019-23 Strategic Plan.</p>

            

            <p>Governance – A voluntary board of 13 elected members govern UHN, as well as three members appointed by the University of Toronto, and representatives from various areas of the hospital.

            Funding – Primary funding for UHN comes from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Other funding sources include patient services, grants and donations from individuals and corporations.

            University Health Network is a research hospital fully affiliated with the University of Toronto.</p>
